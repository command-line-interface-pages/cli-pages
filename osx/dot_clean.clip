> More information: https://ss64.com/osx/dot_clean.html

- Merge all `._*` files recursively:

`dot_clean {directory some description}`

- Don't recursively merge all `._*` in a directory (flat merge):

`dot_clean -f {directory some description}`

- Merge and delete all `._*` files:

`dot_clean -m {directory some description}`

- Only delete `._*` files if there's a matching native file:

`dot_clean -n {directory some description}`

- Follow symlinks:

`dot_clean -s {directory some description}`

- Print verbose output:

`dot_clean -v {directory some description}`
