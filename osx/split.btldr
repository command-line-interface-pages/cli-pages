> More information: https://ss64.com/osx/split.html

- Split a file, each split having 10 lines (except the last split):

`split -l {int value: 10} {file value}`

- Split a file by a regular expression. The matching line will be the first line of the next output file:

`split -p {string value: cat|^[dh]og} {file value}`

- Split a file with 512 bytes in each split (except the last split; use 512k for kilobytes and 512m for megabytes):

`split -b {int value: 512} {file value}`
