## How to get started?

Before writting your own page try explore existing ones.
Start with [one](./common/sleep.clip) of the simplest pages.

Each page should explain the following aspects of described commands:

- command properties like it's name, way to get full documentation
- command examples, at least one

To make user see where it's allowed to write some arbitrary (but valid) content
it's allowed to surround some piece of text with curly braces like
`{int character count}`.
