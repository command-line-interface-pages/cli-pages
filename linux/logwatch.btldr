> Summarizes many different logs for common services (e.g. apache, pam_unix, sshd, etc.) in a single report
> More information: https://manned.org/logwatch

- Analyze logs for a range of dates at a certain level of detail:

`logwatch --range {string value: yesterday|today|all|help} --detail {string value: low|medium|others}'`

- Restrict report to only include information for a selected service:

`logwatch --range {string value: all} --service {string value: apache|pam_unix|etc}`
