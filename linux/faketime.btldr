- Fake the time to this evening, before printing the result of `date`:

`faketime '{any something}' {any something}`

- Open a new `bash` shell, which uses yesterday as the current date:

`faketime '{any something}' {any something}`

- Simulate how a program would act next Friday night:

`faketime '{any something}' {any something}`
