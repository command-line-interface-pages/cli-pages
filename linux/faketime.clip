- Fake the time to this evening, before printing the result of `date`:

`faketime '{string value: today 23:30}' {string value: date}`

- Open a new `bash` shell, which uses yesterday as the current date:

`faketime '{string value: yesterday}' {string value: bash}`

- Simulate how a program would act next Friday night:

`faketime '{string value: next Friday 1 am}' {file value}`
