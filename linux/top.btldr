- Start top:

`top`

- Do not show any idle or zombie processes:

`top -i`

- Show only processes owned by given user:

`top -u {string user}`

- Sort processes by a field:

`top -o {string value: field_name}`

- Show the individual threads of a given process:

`top -Hp {string value: process_id}`

- Show only the processes with the given PID(s), passed as a comma-separated list. (Normally you wouldn't know PIDs off hand. This example picks the PIDs from the process name):

`top -p $(pgrep -d ',' {string value: process_name})`
