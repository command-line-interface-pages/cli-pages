# ltrace

> Display dynamic library calls of a process
> More information: https://manned.org/ltrace

- Print (trace) library calls of a program binary:

`ltrace ./{file value}`

- Count library calls. Print a handy summary at the bottom:

`ltrace -c {file value}`

- Trace calls to malloc and free, omit those done by libc:

`ltrace -e malloc+free-@libc.so* {file value}`

- Write to file instead of terminal:

`ltrace -o {file value} {file value}`
