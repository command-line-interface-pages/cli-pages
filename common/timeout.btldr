> Run a command with a time limit
> More information: https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/timeout

- Run `sleep 10` and terminate it, if it runs for more than 3 seconds:

`timeout {any something} {any something}`

- Specify the signal to be sent to the command after the time limit expires. (By default, TERM is sent):

`timeout --signal {any something} {any something} {any something}`
