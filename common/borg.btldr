> Deduplicating backup tool
> Creates local or remote backups that are mountable as filesystems
> More information: https://borgbackup.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage/general.html

- Initialize a (local) repository:

`borg init {directory something: repo}`

- Backup a directory into the repository, creating an archive called "Monday":

`borg create --progress {directory something: repo}::{any something} {directory something: source}`

- List all archives in a repository:

`borg list {directory something: repo}`

- Extract a specific directory from the "Monday" archive in a remote repository, excluding all `*.ext` files:

`borg extract {any something}@{any something}:{directory something: repo}::{any something} {directory something: target} --exclude '{any something}'`

- Prune a repository by deleting all archives older than 7 days, listing changes:

`borg prune --keep-within {any something} --list {directory something: repo}`

- Mount a repository as a FUSE filesystem:

`borg mount {directory something: repo}::{any something} {any something}`

- Display help on creating archives:

`borg create --help`
