- Match a variable against string literals to decide which command to run:

`case {any something} in {any something}) {any something}; ;; {any something}) {any something}; ;; esac`

- Combine patterns with |, use * as a fallback pattern:

`case {any something} in {any something}) {any something}; ;; {any something}) {any something}; ;; *) {any something}; ;; esac`
