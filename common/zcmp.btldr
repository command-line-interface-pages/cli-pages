# zcmp

> Compare compressed files
> More information: https://manned.org/zcmp

- Invoke `cmp` on two files compressed via `gzip`:

`zcmp {string value: path/to/file1.gz} {string value: path/to/file2.gz}`

- Compare a file to its gzipped version (assuming `.gz` exists already):

`zcmp {file value}`
