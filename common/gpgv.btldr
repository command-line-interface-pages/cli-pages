# gpgv

> Verify OpenPGP signatures
> More information: https://www.gnupg.org/documentation/manuals/gnupg/gpgv.html

- Verify a signed file:

`gpgv {file something}`

- Verify a signed file using a detached signature:

`gpgv {any something} {file something}`

- Add a file to the list of keyrings (a single exported key also counts as a keyring):

`gpgv --keyring {any something} {any something} {file something}`
