# convmv

> Convert filenames (NOT file content) from one encoding to another
> More information: https://www.j3e.de/linux/convmv/man/

- Test filename encoding conversion (don't actually change the filename):

`convmv -f {any something} -t {any something} {file something: input}`

- Convert filename encoding and rename the file to the new encoding:

`convmv -f {any something} -t {any something} --notest {file something: input}`
