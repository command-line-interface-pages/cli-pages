> More information: https://rclone.org

- List contents of a directory on an rclone remote:

`rclone lsf {any something}:{directory something}`

- Copy file or directory from local source to remote destination:

`rclone copy {directory something: source_file_or} {any something}:{directory something: destination}`

- Copy file or directory from remote source to local destination:

`rclone copy {any something}:{directory something: source_file_or} {directory something: destination}`

- Sync local source to remote destination, changing the destination only:

`rclone sync {file something|path something} {any something}:{directory something}`

- Move file or directory from local source to remote destination:

`rclone move {file something|path something} {any something}:{directory something}`

- Delete remote file or directory (use `--dry-run` to test, remove it to actually delete):

`rclone --dry-run delete {any something}:{file something|path something}`

- Mount rclone remote (experimental):

`rclone mount {any something}:{directory something} {any something}`

- Unmount rclone remote if CTRL-C fails (experimental):

`fusermount -u {any something}`
