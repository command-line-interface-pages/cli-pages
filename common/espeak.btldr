> Uses text-to-speech to speak through the default sound device
> More information: http://espeak.sourceforge.net

- Speak a phrase aloud:

`espeak "I like to ride my bike."`

- Speak a file aloud:

`espeak -f {file value}`

- Save output to a WAV audio file, rather than speaking it directly:

`espeak -w {file value: sample.wav} "It's GNU plus Linux"`

- Use a different voice:

`espeak -v {string value: voice}`
