> Generate bindings between C / C++ code and various high level languages such as JavaScript, Python, C#, and more
> It uses special .i or .swg files to generate the bindings (C/C++ with SWIG directives, then outputs a C/C++ file that contains all the wrapper code needed to build an extension module
> More information: http://www.swig.org
