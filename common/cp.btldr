# cp

> Copy files and directories
> More information: https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/cp

- Copy a file to another location:

`cp {file something: source} {file something: target}`

- Copy a file into another directory, keeping the filename:

`cp {file something: source} {directory something: target_parent}`

- Recursively copy a directory's contents to another location (if the destination exists, the directory is copied inside it):

`cp -R {directory something: source} {directory something: target}`

- Copy a directory recursively, in verbose mode (shows files as they are copied):

`cp -vR {directory something: source} {directory something: target}`

- Copy text files to another location, in interactive mode (prompts user before overwriting):

`cp -i {any something} {directory something: target}`

- Follow symbolic links before copying:

`cp -L {any something} {directory something: target}`

- Use the first argument as the destination directory (useful for `xargs ... | cp -t <DEST_DIR>`):

`cp -t {directory something: target} {path* something}`
