- Make a directed graph acyclic by reversing some edges:

`acyclic {string value: path/to/input.gv} > {string value: path/to/output.gv}`

- Print if a graph is acyclic, has a cycle, or is undirected, producing no output graph:

`acyclic -v -n {string value: path/to/input.gv}`

- Display help for `acyclic`:
