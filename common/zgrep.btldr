# zgrep

> Grep text patterns from files within compressed file (equivalent to grep -Z)
> More information: https://manned.org/zgrep

- Grep a pattern in a compressed file (case-sensitive):

`zgrep {any something} {any something}`

- Grep a pattern in a compressed file (case-insensitive):

`zgrep -i {any something} {any something}`

- Output count of lines containing matched pattern in a compressed file:

`zgrep -c {any something} {any something}`

- Display the lines which donâ€™t have the pattern present (Invert the search function):

`zgrep -v {any something} {any something}`

- Grep a compressed file for multiple patterns:

`zgrep -e "{any something}" -e "{any something}" {any something}`

- Use extended regular expressions (supporting `?`, `+`, `{}`, `()` and `|`):

`zgrep -E {any something} {file something}`

- Print 3 lines of [C]ontext around, [B]efore, or [A]fter each match:

`zgrep -{any something} {int number: 3} {any something} {any something}`
