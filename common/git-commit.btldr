# git commit

> Commit files to the repository
> More information: https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit

- Commit staged files to the repository with a message:

`git commit -m "{any something}"`

- Commit staged files with a message read from a file:

`git commit --file {file something: commit_message}`

- Auto stage all modified files and commit with a message:

`git commit -a -m "{any something}"`

- Commit staged files and [S]ign them with the GPG key defined in `~/.gitconfig`:

`git commit -S -m "{any something}"`

- Update the last commit by adding the currently staged changes, changing the commit's hash:

`git commit --amend`

- Commit only specific (already staged) files:

`git commit {any something} {any something}`

- Create a commit, even if there are no staged files:

`git commit -m "{any something}" --allow-empty`
