- Compile a bitcode or IR file to an assembly file with the same base name:

`llc {any something}`

- Enable all optimizations:

`llc -O3 {any something}`

- Output assembly to a specific file:

`llc --output {any something}`

- Emit fully relocatable, position independent code:

`llc -relocation-model=pic {any something}`
