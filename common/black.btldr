# black

> A Python auto code formatter
> More information: https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage_and_configuration/the_basics.html

- Auto-format a file or entire directory:

`black {file something|path something}`

- Format the code passed in as a string:

`black -c "{any something}"`

- Output whether a file or a directory would have changes made to them if they were to be formatted:

`black --check {file something|path something}`

- Output changes that would be made to a file or a directory without performing them (dry-run):

`black --diff {file something|path something}`

- Auto-format a file or directory, emitting exclusively error messages to stderr:

`black --quiet {file something|path something}`

- Auto-format a file or directory without replacing single quotes with double quotes (adoption helper, avoid using this for new projects):

`black --skip-string-normalization {file something|path something}`
